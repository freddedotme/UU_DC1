How does the router map packets in the IP network?	By mapping it with a forwarding table, using the prefixes in the destination address in the header.
What is a host or end system?	Any device that is connected to the internet and is the first or last node in the network chain.
What is a communication link?	Different type of links made up of physical media. Some are: coaxied cable, copper wire, optical fiber and radio spectrum.
What is a packet switch?	It takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forward the packet on one of its outgoing communication links. For example a router is a packet switch.
What is transmission rate?	Rate of a communication link measured in bits/second.
What is a packet?	A package containing a segment of some data sent. The segment also contains header bytes. Once all packets are at their end destination they are reassembled into the original data.
What is a route/path?	The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from send end system to receive end system.
What is a ISP?	Internet Service Provider. End system access to the Internet.

What are distributed applications?	Applications that involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other (VoIP, P2P, web surfing, streaming).
What is an API?	Application Programming Interface. Specifies how a program running on one end asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. The Internet API is a set of rules that the program must follow so it can deliver data to the destination program.
What is physical media?	- Copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber-optic (guided media)<div>- Wireless LAN, digital satellite channel (unguided media)</div>
What is a guided shared medium?	A number of end systems connected directly to the medium. Each end system is receiving whatever is sent by the other end systems.
What is tranmissions rate? How do you calculate transmission time?	Transmission rate is the rate of how quick it can push packets onto the link, it's measured in bits/sec.<div>Its calculated L/R where L = bits and R = bits/second.</div>
What is store-and-forward transmission?	It's used by packet switches. The packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin transmitting the first bit onto the outbound link.
What is the general case of calculating end-to-end delay?	d_end-to-end = N (L/R) where L = bits, R = bits/second, N = links.
What is the output buffer/output queue (regarding packet switches)?	It stores the packets that the router is about to send in a specific link. Each attached link has a buffer.
What is queueing delay?	It's a delay that depends on the level of congestion in the network. If the currrent outgoing link is busy the packet will wait in the output buffer. It's the amount of time until it can transmit.
What is packet loss?	Buffer space is finite and therefore if the buffer is full when the packet is arriving either it will be dropped or an already queued packet will.
What is a forward table? (regarding routers)	It maps destination addresses (or portions of) to the router's outbound links. On packet arrival it searches the table and redirect accordingly.
What is a routing protocol?	The Internet has a number of specific routing protocols that are used to automatically set the forward table. For example, calculating shortest paths between routers.
What is circuit switching? (router)	In circuit-switched networks the resources/buffer and link transmission rates are reserved for the duration of the session. Opposite to packet-switching.
What is FDM?	Frequency-division multiplexing. The frequence spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link. Example is FM radio sharing frequency spectrum of 88MHz-108MHz.
What is TDM?	Time-division multiplexing. Time is divided into frames of fixed duration and each fram is divided into a fixed number of time slots. New connections gets a dedicated slot in every frame.
What is IXP?	Internet Exchange Point. Meeting point where multiple ISP:s can peer together.
What is processing delay?	Time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet. Can also include bit-level error checking.
How do you calculate queing delay?	(n-1) L/R where L = bits, R = bits/second, n = order in queue
What is transmission delay? How do you calculate it?	The amount of time required to push all of the packet's bits onto the link. L/R, where L = bits, R = bits/second.
What is propagation delay?	The time required to propagate (transfer) from the beginning of the link to the destination switch/end system. Speed s used in calculations are between 2*10^8m/s - 3*10^8m/s. Delay = d/s where d = distance.
What is total nodal delay?	The total delay of sending data: d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop
What is traffic intensity? How do you calculate it?	La/R where L = packet size in bits, a = packets/sec, R = bits/sec (transmission rate). Golden rule is to keep traffic inensity &lt;= 1.
What is End-to-End delay?	The total delay from source to destination without any queue delay. d_end-end = N (d_proc + d_trans + d_prop) where N = switches.
What is instantanous througput?	At any instant of time is the rate (bit/s) at which receive destination host is receiving data from send destination.
How do you calculate average throughput?	F/T where F = total data bits, T = seconds until receive destination has received all F bits from send destination.
What is a bottleneck link?	It's the link with lowest rate/quality. Assume you have a host A connected to host B via 1 router. The rate between host A and router is denoted R_a and respectively R_b for host B. Finding the bottleneck link is found with min(R_a, R_b). To find the approximate time to send data between host A and B would be F/(min(R_a, R_b)) where F = bits of data.
What is the Internet Protocol Stack?	The IPS consists of fiver layers: physical, link, network, transport and application. It's used to communicate on the Internet.
What is the Application Layer?	It's where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside (HTTP, SMTP, FTP). This packet of information is called message.
What is the Transport Layer?	Messages between applications endpoints. Two protocols that are mostly used are TCP (guaranteed delivery, congestion control) and UDP (connectionless service, no reliability). Packets are called segments.
What is the Network Layer?	Responsible for moving network-layer packets known as datagram from one host to another. The transport-layer passes segment and destination adress to the network layer. It provides the service of delivering the segment to the transport-layer at the destination host. It also contains: IP, routing protocols (datagram).
What is the Link Layer?	To move a packet from node to node the Network layer rely on the services of the Link layer. At each node the Network layer passes the datagram to the Link layer which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. On arrival the Link layer passes the datagram up to Network layer. Some protocols are: Ethernet, WiFi. Packets are called frames.
What is the Physical Layer?	The move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. Protocols are link dependent and depend on the transmission medium. For example Ethernet has many Physical layer protocols, for example: Copper wire and Fiber.
What is encapsulation refering to in the IPS?	Each layer in the IPS adds some header bytes to the payload. This works similarly as posting a letter where the Application layer is the message, the Transport layer is the letter and so on.
What is the relation between Transport and Network layers?	The services that a Transport layer protocol can provide are often constrained by the service model of the underlying Network layer protocol. Transport layer protocol provides logical communication between processes running on different hosts where as Network layer protocol provides logical communication between hosts.
What is multiplexing?	Its purpose is to gather data chunks at the source host from different sockets. It encapsulates each data chunk with header information to create segments and then pass them to the Network layer.
What is demultiplexing?	"Its purpose is to at the receiving end examine the ""multiplexed"" segments and direct the segment to the correct socket."
What is source port number field and destination port number field? (UDP)	It's a 16 bit number (0-65535) and it directs the segment to the correct socket.
What are reasons to pick UDP over TCP?	- Finer application-level control over what data is sent and when (perfect for realtime apps)<br />- No connection establishment<br />- No connection state<div>- Small packet header overhead (8 bytes vs TCP with 20 bytes)</div>
What does the UDP segment contain?	- Source port (16 bits)<br />- Destination port (16 bits)<div>- Length (16 bits) - number of byte in the UDP segment (header + data)</div><div>- Checksum (16 bits) - receiving host checks for errors</div><div>- Message (32 bits) - data</div>
How does UDP checksum work?	At the sender the destination and length are added together as a sum. With the resulting sum the sender does a 1s complement and store that in the checksum field. At the receiver it adds all 16 bits field together and if the sum only contains 1s there is no error.
What do we mean with end-end principle? (UDP)	"UDP implements error checking because there is no guarantee that all the link between source and estination provide error checking. ""Functions placed at the lower levels may be redundant or of little value when compared to the cost of providing them at the higher level.""."
What is ARQ?	Automatic Repeat reQuest. It has to have the following capabilities:<br />- Error detection - mechanism for the receiver<div>- Receiver feedback - provide explicit feedback to the send (ACK/NAK are examples)</div><div>- Retransmission - A packet that is received in error will be retransmitted by the sender.</div>
What is pipelining and what its consequences?	Sender is allowed to send multiple packets without waiting for acknowledgments. <br />Some consequences are:&nbsp;<div>- Range of sequence numbers must be increased and and must be unique</div><div>- Both sides may have to buffer more than one packet (transmitted but not ACK:ed)</div><div>- Range of sequence numbers and buffer requirement will depend on the manner in which a data transfer protocol respond to lost, corrupted and overly delayed packets.</div>
What is Go-Back-N?	Sender is allowed t osend multiple packets without waiting for acknowledgement but is constrained to have no more than some max allowable &nbsp;N of not ACK:ed packets in the pipeline.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>- Transmitted and ACK:ed - [0, base -1]</div><div>- Sent not yet ACK:ed - [base, nextseqnum - 1]</div><div>- Packets that can be sent immedieatly - [nextseqnum, base + N - 1]</div><div>- Not usable yet - seqnum &gt; base + N</div><div>- Window size - [base, base + N - 1]</div><div><br /></div><div>It's called a sliding window protocol and uses cumulative ACK:s - packet with sequence number &lt;= n have been sucessfully sent.</div>
What is SR?	Selective repeat. Avoids unnecessary retransmissions by having the sender retransmit only those packet that it suspects were recevied in error at the receiver. The receiver also has a buffer to keep an eye on already received packets. (ADD MORE)
What is TCP?	"<div>Transmission Control Protocol.</div>Connection-oriented protocol and reliability. Must ""handshake"" before data transfers.<div><br /><div>- Full duplex - data flow from both hosts.</div><div>- Three-way handshake</div></div><div>- Send/receive buffer - set aside during handshake.</div><div>- MSS - maximum segment size - set by determining length of the larget Link layer frame.</div><div>- TCP segment (encapsulation in IP datagram) + TCP/IP header must fit in frame.</div>"
What is a TCP segment?	TCP pairs each chunk of client data with a TCP header. Network layer encapsulate the segment with Network layer IP datagrams. On arrival its placed in the receive TCP buffer.
Explain the TCP segment structure	- Source/destination port (each 16 bit)<div>- Sequence number (32 bit)</div><div>- Acknowledgment number (32 bit)</div><div>- Receive window (16 bit) - flow control</div><div>- Header length field (4 bit) - specifies length of TCP header (typically 20 bytes).</div><div>- Options (32 bit/variable)</div><div>- Flag field (6 bit)</div><div>-- ACK (1 bit) - ACK field is valid</div><div>-- RST, SYN, FIN (1 bit/each) - connection setup/teardown</div><div>-- PSH (1 bit) - pass data immed. to upper layer.</div><div>--URG (1 bit) - upper-layer marked as urgent.</div><div>- Internet checksum (16 bit)</div><div>- Urgent data pointer (16 bit)</div><div>- Data (32 bit)</div>
How does sequence numbers work in TCP?	Sequence numbers are over the stream of transmitted bytes. It starts at a random number (security).
How does ACK numbers work in TCP?	The ACK number put in the segment is the sequence number of the next byte host A is expecting from host B (cumulative). Out of order segments are either discared or kept and waiting.
What is SampleRTT?	Amount of time between a segment is sent and an ACK is received for it. New value approximately each RTT.
What is EstimatedRTT?	Average SampleRTT. EstimatedRTT = (1 - alpha) * EstimatedRTT + alpha * SamplteRTT. alpha = 0.125 (usually).
What is DevRTT?	Estimate of how much SampleRTT typically deviates from EstimatedRTT. DevRTT = (1 - beta) * DevRTT + beta * |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|. beta = 0.25 (usually).
How are timeout intervals working in TCP?	Timeout intervals is the time TCP waits until it retransmits. TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT. Default is usually 1 second and it doubles on timeout.
"What does ""forwarding"" mean?"	The act of a single router sending a packet from an incoming link to an ougoing link.
"What does ""routing"" mean?"	It involves all network routers, whose collective interactions via routing protocols determine the paths that packets take on their trips from the source to destination.
What do routers use to know where to send packets?	Forwarding tables.
What is a connection-oriented network called?	Virtual Circuit (VC) network
What is a connectionless-oriented network called?	Datagram network.
What happens to the VC number in a packet's header?	It's updated and changed along its path through the network. It's used to determine which outgoing links to be sent to.
What happens when a new VC number is created?	All forwarding tables in the packet's path are updated to include the new VC number.
How do routers send packets in a datagram network?	The destination address in the packet header is matched with the longest prefix in the forwarding table.&amp;nbsp;
How often is a forwarding table updated in a datagram network, and what consequences does it have?	Every one-to-five minutes, and since this can happen at any time, a series of packets may arrive out of order because the paths were switched mid-transer.
What is duplicate ACK:s used for in TCP?	Arrival of out-of-order segment with higher-than-expected sequence number. In other words it detects a gap/packet loss. Recevier sends double ACK with sequence number of next expected byte (start of gap). If three duplicate ACK:s are received the sender does a fast retransmit.
What is flow-control service (TCP)?	Eliminates the possibility to overflow the receiver's buffer. It matches the rate of which the sender is sending against the rate at which the receiving application is reading.
What is a recieve window (TCP)? How do you calculate it?	Informs the sender of how much free buffer space is available at the reciever.<div><br /></div><div>The following variables exists:</div><div>- LastByteRead - number of last byte in the datastream read from the buffer by the application process.</div><div>- LastByteRcvd - number of last byte in the data stream from the network that has been placed in the receive buffer.</div><div><br /></div><div>Calculation:</div><div>RecieveWindow = RcvBuffer - (LastByteRcvd - LastByteRead)</div><div><br /></div><div>Receive window exists in each segment sent. The sender makes sure LastByteSent - LastByteAcked &lt;= Recieve window.</div><div>Once the receive window is full the sender keeps sending segments with one byte of data until space is available again.</div>
How does TCP establish a connection?	1. Sends a specific TCP segment called a SYN segment. No data except for SYN bit is set to 1. It also randomly generates an initial sequence number that is stored in client_isn. It is encapsulated in an IP datagram and then sent.<div>2. Receiver allocates buffers/variables and sensds a SYNACK segment back (SYN = 1, ACK-field = client_isn + 1, Seq.number = server_isn).</div><div>3. On arrival client allocates buffer/variables and sends one last TCP segment (SYN = 0, ACK-field = server_isn + 1).</div>
How does TCP close a connection?	1. Client sends a TCP segment (FIN = 1) and enters a FIN_WAIT_1 state.&nbsp;<div>2. Client receives an ACK from the receiver and enters FIN_WAIT_2 state.</div><div>3. Client receives a TCP segment from the receiver (FIN = 1) and enters TIME_WAIT state.</div><div>4. After approximately 30 seconds the client closes the connection and releases resources.</div>
What are the causes and cost of congestion?	- Large queueing delays are experienced when packet arrival rate nears the link capacity.<div>- Retransmissions in order to compensate for dropped(lost) packets due to buffer overflow.</div><div>- Unneeded retransmissions in the face of large delays that may cause a router to use its link's bandwith to forwards copies of a packet.</div><div>- When a packet is dropped along a path, the transmassion capacity used at each upstream link is wasted.</div>
What are some approaches to congestion control?	- End-to-end congestion control (!!! there exists a question in this deck that will get into more detail)<div>- Network-assisted congestion control&nbsp;(!!! there exists question in this deck that will get into more detail)</div>
What is End-to-end congestion control?	Network layer provides no explicit support to the Transport layer. Presence of congestion in the network is inferred by the end system, for example for packet loss and delays.
What is network-assisted congestion control?	Network-layers components (routers) provide explicit feedback to the sender regarding the congestion state in the network. Could be as simple as a bit indiciating congestion or the router marking the packet.
What is ATM ABR congestion control? Explain specifically what ATM and ABR does. Also explain RM cells.	Network-assisted approach.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>- ATM</div><div>Takes a virtual-circuit oriented approach towards packet switching. Allows a switch to track behavior of individual sendesr and take source-specific congestion control (reduce rate etc.).</div><div><br /></div><div>- ABR</div><div>Is an elastic data transfer service. Takes advantage of spare available bandwith when the network is underloaded. It throttles rate to some predetermined minimum rate when network is congested.</div><div><br /></div><div>- RM cells</div><div>Resource-management cells. Provides direct network feedback and feedback via the receiver. A switch can also generate these.</div><div>EFCI bit (explicit forward congestion indication), CI bit (congestion indication), NI bit (no increase), ER-field (min supportable rate of all switches).</div>
How does TCP congestion control work?	TCP uses end-to-end congestion control since IP layer doesnt provide explicit feedback to the end systems regarding congestion. Each sender limits its rate of sent traffic into its connection dependent of the perception of network congestion.
How does a TCP sender limit their rate?	It keepts track of additional variable, congestion window (cwnd), which imposes a constraint on the rate.<div>LastByteSent - LastByteAcked &lt;= min (cwnd, rwnd). Send rate is roughly cwnd/RTT.</div>
How does TCP percieve there is a congestion?	Either a timeout or the receipt of three duplicate ACK:s is an indication of congestion.&nbsp;
How does a TCP sender determine the rate at which it should send?	- A lost segment indicates that the network have congestion, thus the the rate should be decreased.<div>- An ACK segment indicates everything is fine thus the rate can be increased.</div><div>- Bandwith probing - Increases its rate on arriving ACK:s until a loss event occurs at which the rate is decreased. Probing repeats.</div>
Explain TCP slow start	On initial connection TCP starts with a value on cwnd being 1 MSS. It increases with 1 MSS for each ACK (rate is doubling and therefore increasing exponentially).<div>On timeout it sets a state variable, sstresh, to cwnd /2 (half the value of prev. congestion) and sets MSS to 1 and repeats the process.</div><div><br /></div><div>Once cwnd = sstresh it transitions into Congestion avoidance mode.</div>
Explain TCP Congestion avoidance	Since the value of cwnd is close to congetion it carefully increases by 1 MSS each RTT.<div>(NEED MORE INFO HERE!)</div>
How do you calculate average TCP throughput?	(0.75 * W)/RTT where W = value of window size when loss event occured.
Explain TCP Fast recovery	(NEED MORE!)
What are some important differences between wired and wireless link?	- Wireless has decreasing signal strength<div>- Wireles can have interference from other sources</div><div>- Wireless have Multipath propagation</div>
What is SNR?	"Signal-to-noise ratio (measured in dB). Relative measure of the strength of the receieved signal. Bigger SNR makes it easier to extract signal. ""The higher SNR the lower BER (bit error rate)""."
What is hidden terminal problem?	A and B are both transmitting to C. But because of physical obstruction it prevents A and B from hearing eachother even though their transmissions are interferred at C.
What is fading?	A and B are both transmitting to C. Their signals are not strong enough to notice eachother but they are still interferring at C.
What is CDMA? How does it work?	<div>Code divisin multiple access. It's a channel partioning protocol.</div>(NEED TO ADD MORE!)
