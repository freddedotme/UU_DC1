How does the router map packets in the IP network?	By mapping it with a forwarding table, using the prefixes in the destination address in the header.
"What does ""forwarding"" mean?"	The act of a single router sending a packet from an incoming link to an ougoing link.
"What does ""routing"" mean?"	It involves all network routers, whose collective interactions via routing protocols determine the paths that packets take on their trips from the source to destination.
What do routers use to know where to send packets?	Forwarding tables.
What is a connection-oriented network called?	Virtual Circuit (VC) network
What is a connectionless-oriented network called?	Datagram network.
What happens to the VC number in a packet's header?	It's updated and changed along its path through the network. It's used to determine which outgoing links to be sent to.
What happens when a new VC number is created?	All forwarding tables in the packet's path are updated to include the new VC number.
How do routers send packets in a datagram network?	The destination address in the packet header is matched with the longest prefix in the forwarding table.&nbsp;
How often is a forwarding table updated in a datagram network, and what consequences does it have?	Every one-to-five minutes, and since this can happen at any time, a series of packets may arrive out of order because the paths were switched mid-transer.
